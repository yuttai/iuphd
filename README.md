IU Thesis Document Class

# Propose
Although the department of Mathematics has a LaTeX template to wrtie IU Thesis (https://math.indiana.edu/graduate/index.html), the output it produces is not completely follow the requirement of the graduate school (https://graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/index.html). The propose of this project is to upgrade with the current format, to extend its flexibility for the various situations while keepping its good documentation. We hope the updated version could be used to update the website of the department of Mathematics, after our thesis is accepted by the graduate school.
