IU Thesis Document Class

# Propose
This document is based on the LaTeX template to wrtie IU Thesis provided by the department of Mathematics (https://math.indiana.edu/student-portal/graduate/iu-thesis-class.html) downloaded on Jan. 30, 2018. At that time, the output it produces is not completely follow the requirement of the graduate school (https://graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/index.html). The propose of this project is to upgrade with the current format, to extend its flexibility for the various situations while keeping its good documentation. 

Notice that the department of Mathematics has updated is document class on Mar. 18, 2019 whose output acceptable as of Summer 2018.  Since the document class updated by the department of Mathematics was not completely the same as mine, I hope to confirm whether there is any useful patches updated here could be sent back to the department of Mathematics after my thesis is accepted by the graduate school. After that, since this is formated as a document class, I hope this can be published to CTAN (https://ctan.org/) so that the students can get it from MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/) or TeXLive (https://tug.org/texlive/).
