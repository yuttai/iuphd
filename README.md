IU Thesis Document Class

# Propose
This document class is based on the LaTeX template provided by the department of Mathematics (https://math.indiana.edu/student-portal/graduate/iu-thesis-class.html) downloaded on Jan. 30, 2018. After updating according to the requirement of the Univeristy Graduate School (UGS) (https://graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/index.html), a thesis producted by this class is accepted by UGS on June 4, 2019. 

Notice that the department of Mathematics has updated their document class on Mar. 18, 2019 whose output is acceptable as of Summer 2018.  Since the document class updated by the department of Mathematics was not completely the same as mine, I hope to confirm whether I could send any useful patches to the department of Mathematics. After that, since this is formatted as a document class, I hope this can be published to CTAN (https://ctan.org/) so that the students can get it from MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/) or TeXLive (https://tug.org/texlive/).

# Feature
* The month and year in the first page is the same as the compiled month and year.
* Unlimitted major departments and committee members.
* Fine control on the space in the acceptance and abstract pages.
* Easier to switch whether preambles show in the table of contents or not.
* Use different fonts for texts and commands in the documentation.

# Acknowledgments
